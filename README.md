# Text Classification using Natural Language Processing
This is my final exam project from a Machine Learning Course. 
The project aims to teach an algorithm for classifying text into 4 different categories. 

## What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.

## The Dataset
In this project I used dataset for classification of News descriptions. There are 4 categories: Sports, Business, World, SciTech. This is a manually curated dataset of news description and their classes from AGWeb.com.. I got the dataset from https://medium.com/@dataturks/rare-text-classification-open-datasets-9d340c8c508e .

### Language used
  - Python

### Platform used
  - Jupyter Notebook

## What I covered?
  - Feature Extraction
  - Regular Expressions
  - Feature Engineering
  - A few scikit-learn Classification Algorithms

## What I used?
  - The nltk library for the language processing operations such as removing stems and stopwords
  - The pandas library for the dataframe operations
  - The scikit-learn library for the algorithms,getting the features and separating the data
